# push2talk

[Push-to-talk demo with `SpeechRecognition` API.](https://qwertie.github.io/push2talk/)

(Not the greatest code; prototyped with AI. Truth is, the only reason I put this up on 
GitHub Pages is because if I run it from a file on my hard drive, Chrome asks for 
permission repeatedly, every time I press the talk button ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. It is said this happens
on all HTTP endpoints.)
